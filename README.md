Simple PCA Project

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) can be conceptualized as a data compression technique. Imagine a dataset as a multi-dimensional cloud of points. PCA aims to find the most informative axes within this cloud. These axes, termed principal components, capture the maximum variation in the data. By projecting the data onto these principal components, we effectively reduce the dimensionality of the dataset while preserving its essential structure. This process is akin to compressing an image without losing crucial details. In essence, PCA is a mathematical tool that transforms complex datasets into simpler representations by identifying underlying patterns and reducing redundancy.
